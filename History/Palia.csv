After four days travelling by coach, I’ve finally arrived in Kilima Village; a cozy little hamlet near the coast where the Inn has good drinks and friendly company. Though, the place is clearly a backwater seeing as no one here has ever heard of me. The locals, however, make an apple cobbler that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted. It is, no doubt, how the Innkeeper became the stout man he is today! Before I head out for research, I’ve purchased every cobbler that I can find in the village, stuffed myself near to bursting with its sticky, syrupy deliciousness, and packed as many as I can fit into my travel pack. This caused a brief kerfuffle with the local mayor who initially complained about my cobbler-pocalypse, mumbling something about needing them for an upcoming festival. Clearly, the portly fellow wanted all the pies for himself. When I told him I was here on business from the Institute however, his demeanor quickly changed and he became my escort for the day. This was the treatment I should have received upon my arrival, but better late than never I suppose. Though the place is... quaint, my brief time here in Kilima Village has been rather enjoyable overall.

I regret to inform you that the Flothinger is still out there. The trap you helped me set only managed to capture Auni, the pun-farmer's son. The logical conclusion is that he is a cryptid who is yet to be identified... Perhaps Flothingers can shapeshift into Majiri! 

Delaila is furious, despite my assurance that I have years of experience with cryptids and had taken the utmost care in making the trap non-lethal. If you see her, please offer my sincerest apologies and ask if she'd like to have Auni examined. 

I'll continue monitoring the valley. With so many mysteries afoot, perhaps we need a place to store our findings...

Keep your mind metaphysical,

Strange things are afoot with the snails of Kilima! Naturally that means there's a Tuffwoggle about…perhaps even a whole gaggle of them. 

Keep this on you at all times to ward them away.

And remember: question everything!

That ring, it sparkles like the night skies,
Its light in which I yearn to partake.
Shiny baubles light up my eyes.

But wait, there’s more! A delightful surprise!
A wooonderful deal I’d like to make;
Do be fooled by my disguise.

What other trades might I devise?
All your treasures I’d love to take!
Shiny baubles light up my eyes.
Do be fooled by my disguise.

It seems there are less and less Kitsuu around these days. Then again, that is part of the reason we are doing this. To give them a chance at a better future... one we may not be a part of.

Her heart is a fishing net, picky and porous.
Love, it sieves through. Admiration, it holds.
The world stands still in the realm of the Sorceress.

The light of the sun hits the Dragon Shrine’s toruses,

As she got closer and closer, she realized just how big a task she had ahead of her. The cliff rose higher and higher, until at last, she was at its base looking up at an incline that seemed to reach all the way to the very same moon she wanted to catch. The kitsuu puffed up her chest and started on her climb. Onward and onward she ran. Upward and upward she climbed. And yet, further and further the moon seemed to be. As she got close to the edge of the cliff, the kitsuu flopped down in exhaustion and bewilderment—for she was no closer to the moon than she was a cliff’s height ago.

And as the pool grew large enough that the kitsuu’s paws were dipped in it, her tears began to tinkle as they fell directly into the water. Startled by the sound, the kitsuu looked up, and lo and behold, she saw the reflection of Luna shining back at her.

“Why hello!” she exclaimed happily, circling the edge of her pool, around and around, while the moon stayed centered and full, beaming back at her in delight.

Almost overwhelmed by the dizziness, she channeled her inner silverwing and spread her limbs taut so her thick fur could stretch out and catch the air, letting her gently hover above the peak of the geyser. Up and down and up again she bobbed, as she looked around in a bubbling excitement that quickly fizzled as the novelty wore off. She was high, higher than she’d ever been before, but the moon looked no closer than it had on the cliff or in the tree. She was closer to an expansive body of water she had never even seen before than the moon she had been admiring this whole time! The ocean glistened all over as it undulated in the wind, so vast she couldn’t see it in its entirety, and while she had to admit that it was beautiful, her heart was still set on the moon, and it still seemed impossibly far.

/C871C78D4073B7598EB37E8518F96EEE,"Bake Directions:

1) Add the 'ImpostorCaptureSwitch' material function 
as the final node in all materials on your asset. Make
sure TangentSpace option matches material settings.

2) Place asset in scene and hook up to Impostor BP as
the source StaticMeshActor.

3) Set desired maps, XYFrames and press 'RenderFrames'.

4) Adjust Material Settings constants to get best match. 
Values there update instantly once frames are rendered. 
Suggested to tweak in Buffer Visualization Overview 
mode.

5) Set desired asset path/name and press 'Create Static 
Assets' to make textures and Material Instance, with all 
params set.

6) Overwriting existing assets can be done with the 
'Overwrite Existing Assets' button. The references must 
be set in Default->SavedTextures.

Previously saved textures will be set here automatically.

7) To save the Impostor Mesh Cutout, select the 
ProceduralMesh component from the details panel then press the
""Create StaticMesh"" button and choose your location to save to.

8) Note that the default material only hooks up: BaseColor 
(Mask in Alpha) andWorldNormal (Depth in Alpha). CustomLighting 
can optionally be combined into BaseColor. Extra maps will
need to be hooked up manually in the material.",

Became a pirate fer one reason: ta piss off my father. Ain't common in Grimalkin culture ta' stay close to yer parents, but I did just ta spite him. The name of my ship - ""Eobard's Revenge"" - is his. Know he hated tha' more than anything. I heard even his neighbors would ask him 'bout my pillagings!

Slowly built out a crew, Grimalkin and Majiri alike. We became the merriest band of vault raider's this side a' Palia ever did see! Everything changed when I finally met Kamila... she had me at swordpoint, right a' this very cliffside.

The rest a' this story is one only a real treasure hunter can know.",

Night after day after night, she aimlessly wandered around and around and around until one night when she stumbled into a small clearing. Startled, she looked up and saw the moon, as distant as ever. In despair, she collapsed into a puddle of fur on the ground and began to cry. She begged for someone, for anyone, to help her reach the moon.

First, prepare chopped apple into a filling like so. Next, add something to the apples to make them spicy...like, uh spice sprouts? Yeah, that tastes pretty good. And then something to make them sweet, I'm guessing sugar. After your filling is ready, prepare your crust by making dough. Dough contains wheat...and some other stuff...but mostly wheat.

(Editor’s Note: This is a well known area and the tree root in question has been there for decades.) Clearly, the vile and devious Jewel-Wing sprung a trap for me! I hurtled down the hill uncontrollably until a tree stopped my tumble, ending in all of my delicious apple cobbler being smashed all over myself and belongings. No doubt this was part of the little menace’s plan! Now I am sore from the impact, and tired from the exertion. I’ll just lay here for a little while and rest, and eat what cobbler hasn’t been destroyed to get my energy back before I continue my research.",

And there was so much to see! The little kitsuu had not realized how vast the world was, and how much there was in it! As she scurried along the cliffside, the mossy side she had climbed gave way to a darker, sharper edge. She slowed to a careful crawl, and peering over the edge she saw that the cliffs here ended by plunging into a soft bed of sand, punctuated by the occasional rock formations. Every so often, one of the formations burst forth with a geyser, shooting into the sky, and as she watched one erupt she realized that she was looking UP at the top of it. Gasping in delight, she took a deep breath, puffing out her chest once more, and waited for the geyser to drop below her. Before she could change her mind, she gathered up all of her tiny courage, and flung herself over the edge as the geyser erupted once again.

It is I, Professor Bonlin Amepongo. You’ve no doubt heard of me due to my legendary discoveries gathering data for the Encyclopedia Palia, or my well chronicled exploits in Entomology Monthly. When my friends at the Bahari Institute asked me to come to the region and document some of the unique insects that call the area home, I was unable to resist. I’ve had my eye on a trip to this lovely region for years, and I simply cannot wait to catalog some of the marvelous specimens found here, including the Kilima Night Moth; a variant with beautiful silvery wings.

I miss you so much, my smart little baby, and I hope you aren't giving mom too much trouble while I'm gone. This hunt won't last much longer, I promise.

Remember what I taught you, okay? When you get lonely, just look up at the night sky and remember that the stars are watching over you- and those same ones are watching over me too!

Though I did not catalogue any of the fiends that I encountered, only a seasoned explorer such as I, Professor Bonlin Amepongo, could have survived what was clearly an impossible mission from the outset. The region of Kilima is a terrible place. Hostile, unforgiving, and brutal. Inhabited by unnatural beasts and savage barbarians who look to turn you into bait for the region’s monsters with their pies! My advice to you is to stay out of the woods, leave the hard work up to us professionals, and continue buying my books. Until the next adventure!

She couldn’t stay up here forever - as relaxing as it was, she was still stretched taut... as she contemplated her next move she saw a mountain whose peaks disappeared into the clouds. Surely that was where she would be able to meet the moon! So she pondered, and plotted, and the next time the geyser shot her into the air she aimed herself at the mountain, stretching her paws as far as they would go. And then stretched just a bit farther than that, and glided as best she could towards the nearest geyser. And so she made her way, geyser to geyser, shooting up, sailing through the air, bit by bit, towards the mountain off in the distance. Eventually, she found herself landing amongst the trees growing from the base of the mountain. Puffing up her chest one last time, the fur on her chest rippling with energy, she began to climb once more.

To juggle eggs, simply hold two eggs in one hand and one egg in the other. Toss one of the paired eggs gently in the air. Then be sure to throw the egg in your opposite hand immediately after. Finally, it’s time to toss the last egg. Don’t be shy! Just go for it! Toss those eggs! 

Oh, you should also be sure to catch them after. If you don’t you’ll be left cleaning up eggs all over your living room for days.  Eggs all over the rug. Eggs all over the ceiling. Eggs all over the cat...it’s a mess. In fact, if you drop the eggs, you may just want to move.

When initiating courtship, you must both establish your value to each other. Gifts and acts of service will suffice. While the initial steps of courtship are being followed, it would be most improper for the two potential partners to be seen together at night, especially without the permission of their parents. 

Whoever initiated the courtship originally must then decide to take the next step in the relationship. Fetching the Midnight Lily which blooms only in the dead of night and delivering it to your partner will signify acceptance of the courtship. At this point, the two young Majiri may spend time together alone.",

Her pleas echoed far and wide, eventually reaching the Three Ancients.

The Phoenix, preoccupied with saving her noisy wayward people, did not hear her appeals.

The Chimera, his far and quiet solitude broken, turned to face away from the chittering noise and watched instead the technological marvels his inventive and clever people had begun to develop.

He said he was sorry for being so distracted lately, and that he'd make time to hang out with me more. I guess you were right about that whole talking to people thing, even if you DID snoop on me.

Truth is, any real treasure I had is long gone - the crew, tha' gal, the ship. (Well, not tha' ship. Still have that, and I'll sink it before tha' likes of ye can have it.) Funny to write that - always thought that line was somethin' corny that lubbers repeated ta' make themselves feel better.

And don't get me wrong - treasure is great. But I spent most a' it buying the crew and Kamila lovely things, and ta get the heat off our backs. Seeing them happy... well, that made me happier than any gold locked in a vault ever could. Ya can't spend it when yer dead, yeah?",

Furthermore, I discovered that it wasn't fear...or at least, it wasn't JUST fear that was keeping me from going through with my duty. It was guilt. 

What my sister was doing was clearly wrong and I had to put a stop to it! I wrote her a strongly worded letter and she agreed to let the Daiyas stay under their old tax rate...on the condition that I supplement their taxes with gold, of course.

Right before my eyes, it was there one second and the next, it was a shiny multi-colored rock! I'm really at a loss. I've never seen anything like this! You found the statue out in Bahari, right?

When I figured it out, I almost fell out of my chair. It was like, Duh-doey! Obviously that's why Hekla made a fake baby! Her Oneness is to take care of a baby! And I'm not exactly a baby! 

Anyway, I wrote the Bahari Institute to see if I could find out what happened to Sona. So...good news and bad news. I heard back from the Bahari Institute and apparently there were records on a ""Sona Mah"" in the vault where Hekla was found. Unfortunately...they were incomplete.

Before attempting to juggle heavier objects like rubber balls, oranges, or live pekis, I recommend starting with something light like a scarf or a handkerchief. Handkerchiefs are so light that you can simply juggle them by dropping them in the air and picking them back up again. No need to throw them in the air.

Just be sure not to juggle USED handkerchiefs. That’s how you end up with sticky hands.

Great, horrible, winged beasts, beating the air into submission with their silvery blades as they cruised the sky! There must have been 4… no... 8! No… 20 of the monsters flying right toward me! No doubt excited by the scent of my blood! (Editor’s Note: It’s a known fact that Kilima Night Moths do not drink blood, but are attracted to fruit... like apples.) Even the name, “Kilima Night Moth” speaks to murderous intentions if I’ve ever heard it! I ran screaming into the woods as fast and far as I could! Fortunately, I ran into a local hunter who was able to point me back in the direction of the village. I forget the lad’s name now, started with an “H” I think. I tried to warn him of the horrible moth-bats and the danger ahead, but he just looked at me and slowly shook his head. ",
